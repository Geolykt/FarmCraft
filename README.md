# FarmCraft

The continuation of the FarmCraft plugin for Paper 1.18 and beyond

The "official" documentation can be found [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/farmcraft-1-17-fully-custom-crops.50031/)
This project can be built via `java -jar brachyura-bootstrap-0.jar build`. The output jar will be located in the build/libs folder.

Note: this project will not recieve updates if I do not get nagged about this. So if something breaks, create an issue!
